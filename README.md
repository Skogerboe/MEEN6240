ME EN 6240 Final Motor Control Project:

This repository holds the code and results of the MEEN 6240  Motor control Project.

Current loop gain tests:

kp: 900
ki: 0.0009

kp: 10000
ki: 0.001

Position loop control gains were tested and the most consistent and accurate gains were as follows:

kp: 6
ki: 0.00001
kd: 0

There is a small bit of oscillation and overshoot, but is very quick. Other gain combinations resulted in higher oscillation and inaccuracy.
